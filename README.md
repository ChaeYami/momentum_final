## About ToDO-List
- When the length of the list is longer than the box, a scroll bar appears.
- If you click the completed todo-list, you can mark the completion with a text line. (CSS:line-through)
- You can also delete it completely by clicking on the x mark.
### Before logging in
- You can't create a todolist.
- Also you cannot see previously created todo-lists.
I made them guided by text before logging in.
